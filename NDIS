Hereâ€™s a quick walkthrough of the steps I followed to resolve the issue:

1. Create the Rule File: Created the missing `local.rules` file in the `/var/lib/suricata/rules/` directory to store custom rules.

2. Add Some Rules: Edited the `local.rules` file to add a simple test rule, such as detecting ICMP (ping) requests.

3. Verify Configuration: Opened the `suricata.yaml` configuration file to ensure it pointed to the correct path for the `local.rules` file, verifying the `rule-files` section.

4. Restart Suricata: Restarted Suricata using the command `sudo suricata -c /etc/suricata/suricata.yaml -i eth0` to apply the changes and start monitoring the network.

5. Check Logs: Monitored the `fast.log` file to see if Suricata detected any activity based on the newly added rules.

By following these steps, Suricata was set up to actively monitor network traffic and log alerts according to the custom rules.
